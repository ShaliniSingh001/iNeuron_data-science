    " Ans:-\n",
    "    In the case of single inheritance, the derived class performs the inheritance of a single base class. In the case of multiple inheritance, the derived class can acquire multiple base classes. \n",
    "    The derived classes can utilize the features that belong to a single base class.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Advantages of Single Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplicity: Single inheritance simplifies the class hierarchy, making it easier to understand and manage relationships between classes.\n",
    "Avoiding Diamond Problem: The Diamond Problem is a challenge that arises in multiple inheritance when a class inherits from two or more classes that have a common superclass. This can lead to confusion and ambiguity in method and attribute resolution. Single inheritance eliminates the Diamond Problem altogether.\n",
    "Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "In multiple inheritance, a class can inherit properties and behaviors from more than one superclass. This approach allows for greater code reuse by enabling a class to inherit from multiple sources. However, it also introduces complexities related to method and attribute resolution when multiple parent classes define the same methods or attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Reusability: Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit features from multiple parent classes, facilitating a higher degree of code reuse.\n",
    "Mixins and Interfaces: Multiple inheritance can be used to create mixins or interfaces. Mixins are classes that provide a specific set of behaviors that can be added to multiple classes, enhancing modularity.\n",
    "Rich Class Design: Multiple inheritance can lead to more feature-rich class designs by combining attributes and behaviors from different sources.\n",
    "Differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of Superclasses: The primary difference between single and multiple inheritance is the number of superclasses a class can inherit from. Single inheritance allows only one superclass, while multiple inheritance allows more than one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ambiguity and Complexity: Multiple inheritance can lead to ambiguity when parent classes define the same methods or attributes. This requires careful method resolution mechanisms to determine which method is called. Single inheritance avoids such ambiguity by allowing only one direct parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diamond Problem: As mentioned earlier, the Diamond Problem is specific to multiple inheritance, where conflicts arise due to shared ancestor classes. Single inheritance inherently avoids the Diamond Problem.\n",

    "Ans-:In object-oriented programming (OOP), access modifiers are keywords that control the visibility and accessibility of class members (attributes and methods) in different parts of the code. The three main access modifiers are \"private,\" \"protected,\" and \"public.\" \n",
    "Each modifier has a specific role in determining which parts of the code can access class members. The significance of the \"protected\" access modifier in inheritance is related to how it balances encapsulation and code reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Private Access Modifier:\n",
    "Members marked as \"private\" are only accessible within the same class where they are declared.\n",
    "They are not accessible in derived classes, meaning that subclasses cannot directly access or override private members of the parent class.\n",
    "Private members are used for internal implementation details that should not be exposed or modified from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Protected Access Modifier:\n",
    "Members marked as \"protected\" are accessible within the same class and its subclasses (derived classes).\n",
    "Protected members can be inherited by subclasses, allowing them to access or override those members.\n",
    "This modifier strikes a balance between encapsulation and reusability. It allows derived classes to build upon the behavior of the base class while still maintaining some level of control over access.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Public Access Modifier:\n",
    "Members marked as \"public\" are accessible from anywhere in the program, both within and outside the class.\n",
    "Public members are freely accessible and modifiable, which can lead to more flexible and customizable behavior.\n",
